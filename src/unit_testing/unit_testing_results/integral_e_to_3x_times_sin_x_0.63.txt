Expert 1: To find the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x), we can start by applying integration by parts. Let's choose u = sin(x) and dv = e^(3x) dx. Taking the derivative of u, we get du = cos(x) dx, and integrating dv, we get v = (1/3)e^(3x). 

Using the integration by parts formula, the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is given by the formula: 

∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du.

Plugging in the values, we have:

∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = (1/3)e^(3x) * sin(x) - ∫ (1/3)e^(3x) * cos(x) dx.

Expert 2: Now, we can simplify the integral on the right-hand side by applying the substitution method. Let's make the substitution u = e^(3x), which implies du = 3e^(3x) dx. Rearranging, we have dx = (1/3e^(3x)) du. 

Substituting these values into the integral, we get:

∫ (1/3)e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = ∫ (1/3) * u * cos(x) * (1/3e^(3x)) du.

Simplifying, we have:

(1/9) ∫ u * cos(x) du.

Expert 3: To evaluate the integral (1/9) ∫ u * cos(x) du, we can use integration by parts again. Let's choose u = u and dv = cos(x) du. Taking the derivative of u, we get du = du, and integrating dv, we get v = sin(x). 

Using the integration by parts formula once more, the integral becomes:

(1/9) ∫ u * cos(x) du = (1/9) * u * sin(x) - (1/9) ∫ sin(x) du.

Simplifying further, we have:

(1/9) * u * sin(x) - (1/9) * (-cos(x)) + C,

where C is the constant of integration.

Putting it all together, the final solution for the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is:

(1/3)e^(3x) * sin(x) - (1/9)e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9) * cos(x) + C.

Therefore, the consensus among the experts is that the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is (1/3)e^(3x) * sin(x) - (1/9)e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9) * cos(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.
