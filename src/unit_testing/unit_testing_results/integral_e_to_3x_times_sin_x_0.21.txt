Expert 1: To find the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x), we can use integration by parts. Let's choose u = sin(x) and dv = e^(3x) dx. Then, du = cos(x) dx and v = (1/3) * e^(3x).

Applying the integration by parts formula, we have:

∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - ∫ (-1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) dx.

Expert 2: Now, let's simplify the remaining integral using trigonometric identities. We can use the identity cos(x) = (1/2) * (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)).

∫ (-1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = (-1/3) * ∫ e^(3x) * (1/2) * (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) dx.

Using the linearity of integration, we can split this integral into two parts:

= (-1/6) * ∫ e^(3x) * e^(ix) dx - (-1/6) * ∫ e^(3x) * e^(-ix) dx.

Expert 3: Now, let's simplify the exponential functions in the integrals. We can use the property e^(a+b) = e^a * e^b.

= (-1/6) * ∫ e^(3x + ix) dx - (-1/6) * ∫ e^(3x - ix) dx.

= (-1/6) * ∫ e^((3+ i)x) dx - (-1/6) * ∫ e^((3- i)x) dx.

Expert 1: To evaluate these integrals, we can use the u-substitution method. Let's substitute u = (3 + i)x for the first integral and u = (3 - i)x for the second integral.

For the first integral, du = (3 + i) dx, so dx = (1/(3 + i)) du.

= (-1/6) * (1/(3 + i)) * ∫ e^u du.

For the second integral, du = (3 - i) dx, so dx = (1/(3 - i)) du.

= (-1/6) * (1/(3 - i)) * ∫ e^u du.

Expert 2: Now, we can evaluate these integrals. The integral of e^u with respect to u is simply e^u.

For the first integral:

= (-1/6) * (1/(3 + i)) * e^u + C.

For the second integral:

= (-1/6) * (1/(3 - i)) * e^u + C.

Expert 3: Finally, substituting back u = (3 + i)x and u = (3 - i)x, we have:

= (-1/6) * (1/(3 + i)) * e^((3 + i)x) + C.

= (-1/6) * (1/(3 - i)) * e^((3 - i)x) + C.

So, the consensus is that the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is:

(-1/6) * (1/(3 + i)) * e^((3 + i)x) + C.

(-1/6) * (1/(3 - i)) * e^((3 - i)x) + C.

where C is the constant of integration.
