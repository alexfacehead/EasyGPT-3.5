To find the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x), we can use integration by parts. Let's assign u = sin(x) and dv = e^(3x) dx. 

Differentiating u, we have du = cos(x) dx, and integrating dv, we have v = (1/3) * e^(3x).

Using the integration by parts formula ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du, we can now evaluate the integral:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - ∫(1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) dx.

We can now apply integration by parts again to the remaining integral. Let's assign u = cos(x) and dv = (1/3) * e^(3x) dx.

Differentiating u, we have du = -sin(x) dx, and integrating dv, we have v = (1/9) * e^(3x).

Using the integration by parts formula again, we have:

∫(1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = (1/9) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - ∫(1/9) * e^(3x) * (-sin(x)) dx.

Simplifying, we get:

∫(1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = (1/9) * e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9) * ∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx.

Now, we can substitute this result back into the original equation:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - (1/9) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - (1/9) * ∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx.

Rearranging the equation, we have:

(10/9) * ∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - (1/9) * e^(3x) * cos(x).

Finally, we can solve for the integral:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (9/10) * (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - (9/10) * (1/9) * e^(3x) * cos(x).

Simplifying further, we get:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (3/10) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - (1/10) * e^(3x) * cos(x).

Therefore, the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is -(3/10) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - (1/10) * e^(3x) * cos(x).
