Expert 1: To solve this integral, we can use integration by parts. Let's choose e^(3x) as the function to differentiate and sin(x) as the function to integrate.

Expert 2: I agree with Expert 1. Now, let's simplify the integrand using trigonometric identities. We can rewrite sin(x) as (1/2)(e^(ix) - e^(-ix)).

Expert 3: After simplifying the integrand, we can apply the natural logarithm function to the exponential function e^(3x). This will help us integrate the exponential function and simplify the integrand further.

Expert 1: Now that we have simplified the integrand, let's make a substitution. We can let u = e^(3x) and du = 3e^(3x) dx.

Expert 2: I agree with Expert 1. By making the substitution u = e^(3x), we can simplify the integrand to (1/2)(u * sin(x) - u^(-1) * sin(x)).

Expert 3: Once we have made the appropriate substitution, let's find the antiderivative of the function. The antiderivative of (1/2)(u * sin(x) - u^(-1) * sin(x)) with respect to u is (1/2)(-cos(x) * u - ln(u) * sin(x)).

Expert 1: I completely agree with Expert 3. The antiderivative of the function is (1/2)(-cos(x) * e^(3x) - ln(e^(3x)) * sin(x)).

Expert 2: After finding the antiderivative, we can evaluate the definite integral. The definite integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) from 0 to π is [(1/2)(-cos(π) * e^(3π) - ln(e^(3π)) * sin(π))] - [(1/2)(-cos(0) * e^(3*0) - ln(e^(3*0)) * sin(0))].

Expert 3: I agree with Expert 2. Evaluating the definite integral, we get [(1/2)(-1 * e^(3π) - ln(e^(3π)) * 0)] - [(1/2)(-1 * 1 - ln(1) * 0)].

Expert 1: Simplifying further, we have (-1/2)(e^(3π) - 1).

Therefore, the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is (-1/2)(e^(3π) - 1).
