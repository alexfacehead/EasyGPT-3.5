Expert 1: To find the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x), we can use integration by parts. Let u = e^(3x) and dv = sin(x) dx. Applying the integration by parts formula, we have:

∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = -e^(3x) * cos(x) - ∫ -3e^(3x) * cos(x) dx

Expert 2: Now, let's apply integration by parts again to evaluate the remaining integral. Let u = -3e^(3x) and dv = cos(x) dx. This gives us:

∫ -3e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = -3e^(3x) * sin(x) - ∫ -9e^(3x) * sin(x) dx

Expert 3: Continuing this process, we can simplify the integral until we reach a point where we can easily evaluate it. Finally, we obtain the antiderivative of e^(3x) * sin(x) as:

∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = -e^(3x) * cos(x) + 3e^(3x) * sin(x) - 9e^(3x) * cos(x) + C

where C represents the constant of integration.

Therefore, the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is -e^(3x) * cos(x) + 3e^(3x) * sin(x) - 9e^(3x) * cos(x) + C.
