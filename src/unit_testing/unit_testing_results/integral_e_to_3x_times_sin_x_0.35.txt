Expert 1: To find the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x), we can use integration by parts. Let's choose u = sin(x) and dv = e^(3x) dx.

Expert 2: Applying integration by parts, we have du = cos(x) dx and v = (1/3) * e^(3x).

Expert 1: Using the formula for integration by parts, the integral becomes ∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - ∫ (-1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) dx.

Expert 2: Now, we can simplify the integral on the right-hand side. Let's use integration by parts again. Let u = cos(x) and dv = - (1/3) * e^(3x) dx.

Expert 1: Differentiating u, we have du = -sin(x) dx, and integrating dv, we get v = (-1/9) * e^(3x).

Expert 2: Applying integration by parts, the integral becomes - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - (-1/9) * e^(3x) * sin(x) - ∫ (-1/9) * e^(3x) * sin(x) dx.

Expert 1: Simplifying further, we have - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9) * e^(3x) * sin(x) + ∫ (1/9) * e^(3x) * sin(x) dx.

Expert 2: Now, we can see that the integral on the right-hand side is the same as the original integral. Let's denote it as I.

Expert 1: So, we have I = - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9) * e^(3x) * sin(x) + I.

Expert 2: Rearranging the equation, we get 2I = - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9) * e^(3x) * sin(x).

Expert 1: Dividing both sides by 2, we find I = - (1/6) * e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/18) * e^(3x) * sin(x).

Therefore, the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is - (1/6) * e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/18) * e^(3x) * sin(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.
