To find the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x), we can use integration by parts. Let's assign e^(3x) as the "u" function and sin(x) as the "dv" function.

Using the integration by parts formula:

∫u * dv = u * v - ∫v * du

Let's calculate the integral step by step:

u = e^(3x) (choose the exponential function as the "u" function)
du = 3e^(3x) dx (take the derivative of u with respect to x)

dv = sin(x) dx (choose the trigonometric function as the "dv" function)
v = -cos(x) (integrate dv with respect to x)

Now, we can substitute these values into the integration by parts formula:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = -e^(3x) * cos(x) - ∫(-cos(x) * 3e^(3x)) dx

Simplifying the expression:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = -e^(3x) * cos(x) + 3∫e^(3x) * cos(x) dx

We now have a new integral to evaluate, which involves the product of e^(3x) and cos(x). We can use integration by parts again to solve this integral.

Let's assign e^(3x) as the "u" function and cos(x) as the "dv" function.

u = e^(3x)
du = 3e^(3x) dx

dv = cos(x) dx
v = sin(x)

Applying the integration by parts formula:

∫e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = e^(3x) * sin(x) - ∫sin(x) * 3e^(3x) dx

Simplifying the expression:

∫e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = e^(3x) * sin(x) - 3∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx

Now, we have another integral involving the product of e^(3x) and sin(x). We can substitute this expression back into the original equation:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = -e^(3x) * cos(x) + 3(e^(3x) * sin(x) - 3∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx)

We can simplify this equation further:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = -e^(3x) * cos(x) + 3e^(3x) * sin(x) - 9∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx

Now, we can isolate the integral term on one side:

10∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = -e^(3x) * cos(x) + 3e^(3x) * sin(x)

Finally, we divide both sides by 10 to solve for the integral:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = (-e^(3x) * cos(x) + 3e^(3x) * sin(x))/10

Therefore, the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is (-e^(3x) * cos(x) + 3e^(3x) * sin(x))/10.
