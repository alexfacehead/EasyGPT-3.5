Expert 1: To solve the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x), I will choose e^(3x) as the function to differentiate and sin(x) as the function to integrate.

Expert 2: After applying integration by parts, we obtain the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) as the product of two functions. To simplify this integral, I will use trigonometric identities.

Expert 3: Since the integral involves the exponential function e^(3x), we can apply the power rule of integration. The integral of e^(3x) with respect to x is (1/3)e^(3x).

Expert 1: Now, let's move on to the next step. After applying integration by parts, we obtain a new integral. To evaluate this integral, I will choose new functions to differentiate and integrate.

Expert 2: In the new integral, I will once again use trigonometric identities to simplify the expression. By applying these identities, we can often reduce the complexity of the integral and make it easier to evaluate.

Expert 3: Since the new integral involves the exponential function e^(3x), we can apply the power rule of integration again. The integral of e^(3x) with respect to x is (1/3)e^(3x).

Expert 1: Let's continue to the next step. After applying integration by parts multiple times, we may reach a point where the integral becomes more manageable.

Expert 2: By using trigonometric identities repeatedly, we can simplify the expression further and potentially eliminate trigonometric functions altogether.

Expert 3: Since we have already simplified the integral as much as possible, we can now evaluate it using integration rules and formulas.

Expert 1: Finally, the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is given by -(1/3)e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9)e^(3x) * sin(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.

Experts 2 and 3: We agree with Expert 1's answer. The integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is -(1/3)e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9)e^(3x) * sin(x) + C.
