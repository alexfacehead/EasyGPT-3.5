To find the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x), we can use integration by parts. Let's choose u = sin(x) and dv = e^(3x) dx. 

Differentiating u, we get du = cos(x) dx, and integrating dv, we get v = (1/3) * e^(3x).

Using the formula for integration by parts, ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du, we have:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - ∫(1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) dx.

Now, we can apply integration by parts again to evaluate the remaining integral. Let's choose u = cos(x) and dv = (1/3) * e^(3x) dx.

Differentiating u, we get du = -sin(x) dx, and integrating dv, we get v = (1/9) * e^(3x).

Using the formula for integration by parts again, we have:

∫(1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = (1/9) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - ∫(1/9) * e^(3x) * (-sin(x)) dx.

Simplifying the expression, we have:

∫(1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = (1/9) * e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9) * ∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx.

Now, we can substitute this result back into the original equation:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (1/3) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - (1/9) * e^(3x) * cos(x) - (1/9) * ∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx.

Rearranging the equation, we have:

(10/9) * ∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (4/9) * e^(3x) * cos(x).

Finally, we can solve for ∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx:

∫e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = - (4/10) * e^(3x) * cos(x) = - (2/5) * e^(3x) * cos(x) + C,

where C is the constant of integration.

Therefore, the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is - (2/5) * e^(3x) * cos(x) + C.
