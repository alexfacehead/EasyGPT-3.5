To find the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x), we can use integration by parts. 

Let's assign u = sin(x) and dv = e^(3x) dx. 

Taking the derivatives and antiderivatives, we have du = cos(x) dx and v = (1/3)e^(3x). 

Using the formula for integration by parts, we have:

∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = uv - ∫ v du

Substituting the values, we get:

∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = (1/3)e^(3x) * sin(x) - ∫ (1/3)e^(3x) * cos(x) dx

Now, we have a new integral to evaluate, which is (1/3)e^(3x) * cos(x). We can use integration by parts again to solve this integral.

Let's assign u = cos(x) and dv = (1/3)e^(3x) dx. 

Taking the derivatives and antiderivatives, we have du = -sin(x) dx and v = (1/9)e^(3x). 

Using the formula for integration by parts, we have:

∫ (1/3)e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = uv - ∫ v du

Substituting the values, we get:

∫ (1/3)e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = (1/9)e^(3x) * cos(x) - ∫ (1/9)e^(3x) * (-sin(x)) dx

Simplifying further, we have:

∫ (1/3)e^(3x) * cos(x) dx = (1/9)e^(3x) * cos(x) + (1/9)∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx

Now, we can substitute this result back into the original equation:

∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = (1/3)e^(3x) * sin(x) - (1/9)e^(3x) * cos(x) - (1/9)∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx

To solve for the integral, we can move the (1/9)∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx term to the left side:

(10/9)∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = (1/3)e^(3x) * sin(x) - (1/9)e^(3x) * cos(x)

Now, we can solve for the integral:

∫ e^(3x) * sin(x) dx = (3/10) * [(1/3)e^(3x) * sin(x) - (1/9)e^(3x) * cos(x)]

Therefore, the integral of e^(3x) * sin(x) is (3/10) * [(1/3)e^(3x) * sin(x) - (1/9)e^(3x) * cos(x)].
