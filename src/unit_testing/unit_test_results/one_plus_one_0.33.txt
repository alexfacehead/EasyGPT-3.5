Expert 1: The first step is to identify the given information, which in this case is the numbers 1 and 1.

Expert 2: The next step is to formulate an equation that represents the problem. In this case, the equation is 1 + 1.

Expert 3: After formulating the equation, we need to simplify and manipulate it to find the solution. In this case, 1 + 1 simplifies to 2.

Expert 1: Since we have obtained a solution, we can now check if it satisfies the original problem statement. In this case, 2 is indeed the sum of 1 and 1.

Expert 2: Therefore, the answer to the question "What is 1+1?" is 2.

All experts agree that the answer to the question "What is 1+1?" is 2.
